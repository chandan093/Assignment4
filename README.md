# Python File Handling Assignment

This repository contains Python programs demonstrating basic file handling operations such as reading, writing, appending data, and handling file-related errors.

## 📌 Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
- Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`
- Prints the file content line by line with line numbers
- Handles errors gracefully using `FileNotFoundError` if the file does not exist

## 📌 Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
- Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`
- Appends additional user input to the same file
- Reads and displays the final content of the file

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- File Handling
- Exception Handling

## ▶️ How to Run the Programs
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Python file using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
